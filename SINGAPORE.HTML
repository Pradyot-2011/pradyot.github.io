<h1>SINGAPORE</H1>
<br>
<pre>
<P>Singapore is very fun to visit. It has a bird park,
a zoo and many other nice things.
There is a place called Universal Studios which was one
of my favourite amusement parks. I loved the
Transformer ride the most. The first
time I went was when I was one year.
When I was five years, I went with my
brother, my mother, my father and grandfather.<p>
